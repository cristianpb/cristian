# Vim 

I think text editor is something very personal. I really like vim. I think it is [good for my fingers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29500098/is-there-any-data-supporting-a-correlation-between-carpal-tunnels-and-using-keyb). They say that from an ergonomic point of view it is optimized to prevent [musculoskeletal diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury). It uses few short cuts, instead of using modifying touches like _Ctrl_, _Alt_ or _MetaKey_; It uses different function modes (normal, insert, visual and command). This allows the utilisation of commands in [asdf position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing), with the fingers near the central row in rest position, being able to have a continuous typing rate.

It also incite motion to be done without neither the [arrow keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_keys) nor the mouse. Instead single movement is controlled by _HJKL_ keys to avoid the movement of the hand for every manipulations of the text. In addition vim offers [several other motions](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html#operator) capabilities, by word, by line, by paragraph, by places of text, etc.
