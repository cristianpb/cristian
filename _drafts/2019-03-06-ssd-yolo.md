Deep learning algorithms are very useful for computer vision in applications
such as image classification, object detection, or instance segmentation.
The main drawback is that these algorithms need in most cases graphical
processing units to be trained and sometimes making predictions can require to
load a heavy model. 
These is one of the main constrains when putting a deep learning model in production.

In this post, I will explain how to use state of the art deep learning
algorithms for object detection that can run in light environments such as a Raspberrypi.
