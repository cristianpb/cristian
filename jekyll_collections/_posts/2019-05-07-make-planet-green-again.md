description: "After the United States pulled out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, French president Emmanuel Macron expressed his interest to join the climate change battle. He offered world scientists and entrepreneurs work in France in order to make our planet great again. Two years later I would like to analyse how France is doing on this engagement and how AI is contributing to it."
