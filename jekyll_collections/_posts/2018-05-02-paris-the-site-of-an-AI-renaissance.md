description: "As the world has entered into a new era of technological transition, Paris is leading the way for France, and on the race to gain back the delay and learn from its mistakes, erasing 30 years of underperformance in innovation.It’s time to be facing the issues we’re addressing today (labor market, industry shifts, brain drain, policy, ethics, democratisation..) and shape the future as we know it, and one that we all want to live in."
