description: New methodologies of horticulture based-on high-end technology are urgently required to transform the way in which the world is fed.  In this project, we present the results of a hydroponic agriculture PoC, which was developed using Quicklogic's QuickFeather in conjuntion with SensiML to highlight the enormous benefits that the growth of crops without soil brings to the climate change.
