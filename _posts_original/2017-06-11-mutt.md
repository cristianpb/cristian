> Mutt is a text-based mail client renowned for its powerful features. Though over 2 decades old, Mutt remains the mail client of choice for a great number of power-users. 

I use mutt to read my emails as a daily basis. I use offlineimap to sync my
emails data base. `msmtp` to send emails from different emails account without
having to sync them. 


I just decided to use [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) to upload one typical
part of a mutt session: reading emails, and answering using the text editor of
your choice.
